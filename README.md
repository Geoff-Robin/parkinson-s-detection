## Introduction

Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and speech. This project aims to detect Parkinson's Disease by analyzing voice and speech features using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Voice feature extraction using `librosa`
- Machine learning model for classification
- Web application interface for uploading and predicting

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `librosa`
- `Flask`
- `joblib`
- `Werkzeug`
- `pydub`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn librosa Flask joblib Werkzeug pydub
